"""Schema + writer for INTERVENTION launch records (all studies).

WHY THIS EXISTS. A study's *first* launch is well instrumented: the launchers write
`launch_record/beaker_resumable.json` with a fixed schema, and stamp the portable `meta.*` fields into each W&B run config.
wedged tasks, probing a failure, changing priority tier, backfilling a lost metric — has
historically been done with a bespoke script that invented its own JSON shape.

Study 06 is the worked example of the cost. Its five launch records looked like this:

    beaker_resumable.json  (launcher)  {chunk_size, mode, n_chunks, n_tasks, parts}
    beaker_resubmit20.json (by hand)   {bad_node, parts, reason}
    beaker_nanretry1.json  (by hand)   {experiment_id, purpose, tasks}
    beaker_rescue1.json    (by hand)   {bad_node, bad_node_hostname, experiment_id,
                                        progress_discarded, purpose, tasks}
    beaker_tier1.json      (by hand)   {experiment_id, purpose, superseded_experiment,
                                        tasks, thrash_evidence}

No two alike, **none carrying a timestamp**, none using `_meta`. Interventions are exactly
the surprising events provenance exists for, and they were the least well recorded. Prose in
notes.md filled the gap, but prose is not queryable and drifts from reality.

This module fixes the shape, not the prose. `write_intervention()` wraps the existing
`_meta.build_meta()` so every record gets a Seattle-time timestamp and both git SHAs for free.

        deviations={"fresh_run_ids": True, "renamed_tasks": True},
        cost={"progress_discarded_steps": {"060": 76120}},
    )

BEAKER *AND* HPC. The two backends are handled by one schema because a study can and does
use both (AGENTS.md section 13: GPU jobs to Beaker, CPU jobs to HPC SLURM, one repo driving
both). They differ only in what identifies a submitted unit, which is why `job_refs` is a
list of typed refs rather than a Beaker-shaped `experiment_ids`:

    beaker  ->  {"type": "beaker_experiment",  "id": "01K..."}
    hpc     ->  {"type": "wandb_sweep",        "id": "abc123"}     # the durable handle
                {"type": "slurm_array_job",    "id": "12345"}      # ages out of sacct
                {"type": "slurm_job",          "id": "12345_7"}

For HPC prefer the **W&B sweep id**: SLURM job ids are recycled and drop out of `sacct`
history, so a sweep id is the only ref that stays resolvable months later. (`launch_hpc.py`
currently writes no launch record at all — an HPC intervention must call this helper by hand
until that launcher is taught to do it.)

Times are Seattle per AGENTS.md section 7.

        kind: one of :data:`KINDS`.
        platform: one of :data:`PLATFORMS` — ``"beaker"``, ``"hpc"``, or ``"none"`` for a
            kind that submits nothing (backfill).
        wandb_group: the group these runs belong to — the join key that lets the
            validator reconcile records against what actually landed in W&B.
        study_root: ``studies/<study>/``, for the wrapper SHA in ``_meta``.
        job_refs: typed handles for the submitted unit(s), e.g.
            ``[{"type": "beaker_experiment", "id": "01K..."}]`` on Beaker or
            ``[{"type": "wandb_sweep", "id": "abc123"}]`` on HPC. Omit for
            ``kind="backfill"``, which by definition creates no job. On HPC prefer the
            W&B sweep id — SLURM ids are recycled and age out of ``sacct``.
        supersedes: experiment ids (or run ids) this action replaces, so a reader can
            follow the chain backwards without reading prose.
        trigger: why this was needed — requires ``symptom`` and ``cause``, plus any
            ``evidence``. The point is to record the *observation*, not just the verdict.
        tasks: per-task mapping, typically
            ``{orig_task, new_task, orig_wandb_run, new_wandb_run}``.
        deviations: deliberate departures from a plain resubmit — e.g.
            ``{"fresh_run_ids": True, "renamed_tasks": True,
               "context_changed": {"priority": "normal", "preemptible": False}}``.
            Every study-06 intervention made such a choice for a real reason; capturing it
            here makes the reason auditable instead of buried in a commit message.
        cost: what the action gave up, e.g. ``{"progress_discarded_steps": {...}}``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: on an unknown ``kind``/``platform``/ref type, a ``trigger`` missing
